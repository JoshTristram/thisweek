  about: >-
    BBC Earth presents a podcast the size of a planet, telling stories about
    nature, science and our human experience. Immerse yourself in stories about
    our world and the astonishing creatures, landscapes and elements in it. As
    you’re transported from the impenetrable forests of Uganda to research bases
    in the Antarctic; the edges of the Thar Desert to the Shores of Lake Tahoe,
    you’ll experience tales of human emotion, of encounters with animals, of the
    strangest corners of the Earth and breathtaking marvels. All carefully
    gathered together and delivered into your ear by the good people at BBC
    Earth.
