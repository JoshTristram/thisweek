   		<p class="pinfo center editable">BBC Earth presents a podcast the size of a planet, telling stories about nature, science and our human experience.

Immerse yourself in stories about our world and the astonishing creatures, landscapes and elements in it. As you’re transported from the impenetrable forests of Uganda to research bases in the Antarctic; the edges of the Thar Desert to the Shores of Lake Tahoe, you’ll experience tales of human emotion, of encounters with animals, of the strangest corners of the Earth and breathtaking marvels. All carefully gathered together and delivered into your ear by the good people at BBC Earth. </p>
